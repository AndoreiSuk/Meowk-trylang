Hi Dear Diannie!!! Naa koy ipakita saimoa <3 even tho I just modified it since this is not my snippet TwT at least I could share a sweet gesture to you!!! 

p.s - this is all source code files, no malware, no virus, no pharming/phishing scams!!! You trust me naman 100% <3



STEP 1 Download the files: index.html, script.js, styles.css, yes_page.html, yes_style.css

(Whenever you download this, you'll be directed to the source code format of the file, from there... you'll find a download button behind the on the right side from the "RAW" button)

STEP 2 After you downloaded all the files, open the index.html. Enjoy!!!!
